# (Work in Progress) (somewhat abandoned) Aetherial Islands Dimension

This Minecraft datapack puts [klinbee's Aetherial Islands](https://github.com/klinbee/Aetherial-Islands) in a different dimension. It aims to leave the overworld unaffected and reach complete parity with the original project.
I also aim to add compatibility with [No Void Structures](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-void-structures).
Mostly a personal project - I might not ever finish it.

## Current state
The islands have been put into a different dimension which (as far as I am aware) has parity with the original project. To get there, run: /execute in skylands:skylands_dim run tp @s ~ ~ ~
The overworld does not yet reach parity with the vanilla overworld since the original project makes some changes to the world generation.
While it mostly "looks right", some features, such as the large spikes in the eroded badlands biome, will not generate the same way they do in vanilla.

All credit goes to [the original project](https://github.com/klinbee/Aetherial-Islands).
