# (Work in Progress) Aetherial Islands Dimension

This Minecraft datapack puts klinbee's Aetherial Islands in a different dimension (skylands:skylands_dim). It aims to leave the overworld unaffected and reach complete parity with the original project.
I also aim to add compatibility with [No Void Structures](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-void-structures).
I might not ever finish it.

All credit goes to [the original project](https://github.com/klinbee/Aetherial-Islands).
